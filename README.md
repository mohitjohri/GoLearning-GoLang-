# GoLearning-GoLang-

This a repo which will contains all the golang projects which I would create during my learning process. Thought behind creating this repo: As it might be helpful of any individual who would be interested in learning Go and would be helpful to them.





Why did I choose “Go language”?

Because Go language is an effort to combine the #ease of programming# of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.
